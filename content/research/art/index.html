  <h4>1.2 Some literary pahari works</h4>
  <p>Given the predominantly oral nature of the indigenous literary tradition, the most significant and impactful "literature" of Himachal Pradesh is the body of scholarly and descriptive work that has served to document and preserve its culture. These texts, written mostly in Hindi and English, are invaluable resources for understanding the region's history, art, and folklore.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Kullut Desh ki Kahani</strong> by Lal Chand Prarthi: A foundational text that provides a comprehensive account of the history, folklore, and cultural narratives of the Kullu region.</li>
    <li><strong>Kullu: Its Early History, Archaeology and Architecture</strong> and <strong>Temple Architecture of Western Himalaya</strong> by O.C. Handa: These are critical scholarly works that offer an in-depth analysis of the Kullu Valley's material culture, from its ancient temples to its archaeological remains.</li>
    <li><strong>The Wonderland Himachal Pradesh</strong> by Jag Mohan Balokhra: A monumental encyclopedic work that covers all aspects of the state, serving as an indispensable reference guide.</li>
    <li><strong>Kullu and Lahaul</strong> by G.C. Bruce: An important early account that offers historical insights into the region.</li>
    <li>Other notable authors who have contributed significantly to this body of work include Rahul Sankrityayan (<em>Kinner Desh</em>), M.S. Randhawa (for his seminal works on Pahari painting like <em>Guler Painting</em>), and contemporary writers such as Minakshi Chaudhry (<em>Whispering Deodars</em>) and Dilaram Shabab (<em>Kullu: The Valley of Gods</em>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>1.3 Nicholas Roerich</h4>
  <p>The famed Russian painter, writer, archaeologist, and philosopher settled in Naggar, in the Kullu Valley, in the 1920s and lived there until his death in 1947.</p>
  <p>His extensive writings, which include poetry, short stories, and essays, are deeply imbued with his interest in Eastern philosophy, Theosophy, and the palpable spiritual energy of the Himalayas. His essay "Gods of Kuluta" provides a unique and insightful perspective on the devta culture of the valley, capturing the local beliefs with a mystic's sensibility. His literary output offers a perspective that is both external, bringing a global philosophical framework, and deeply engaged with the local spirit. His former residence is now the International Roerich Art Gallery, and the Uruswati Himalayan Folk Art Museum, which he founded, remains a vital cultural institution in Kullu.</p>

  <h3>Section 2: Cinema and the arts</h3>
  <p>A sad reality remains for Himachal that it is atmost used an exotic landscape backdrop for the folks to have a revelation. Reeking of the same "exoticness" with which Wes Anderson treats India in The Darjeeling Express - the gaze of the many bollywood directors is perverted - for the gaze seeks to inflict this mysticism over the whole land instead of ever humanizing the actual people living there. They often fall back to the background as neat little plot points while the main "heroes" have a revelation that they want to live life better because of the mighty power of our pahaads.</p>
  <p>That being said, this is why I seek to highlight some indigenous non-perverted work of and about Pahari people here.</p>
