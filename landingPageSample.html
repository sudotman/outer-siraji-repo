                        <h3>Section 1: Defining Outer Siraji: A Taxonomic and Geographic Investigation</h3>
                        <p>The foundational step in any language preservation initiative is the precise identification of the target linguistic variety. This requires a rigorous examination of its name, its genetic relationship to other languages, and its specific geographic locus. In the case of the dialect specified as "Outer Swaraji," this process is of paramount importance due to significant terminological ambiguity in both historical and contemporary sources. This section provides a definitive clarification of the dialect's identity, resolving potential confusions and establishing a clear, actionable scope for the preservation project.</p>
                        
                        <h4>1.1 Resolving the Siraji/Sarazi/Swaraji Ambiguity</h4>
                        <p>The name "Siraji," of which "Swaraji" is a likely variant, is a homonym applied to two distinct linguistic entities in the Western Himalayas. This has created considerable confusion that could severely compromise a preservation effort if left unaddressed. Any attempt to gather data under the general term "Siraji" will inevitably conflate resources from two separate speech communities, leading to the contamination of the lexical and grammatical database. Therefore, a clear distinction must be maintained throughout the project.</p>
                        <p>The target of this preservation effort is <strong>Outer Siraji</strong>, a dialect spoken in Himachal Pradesh. Its linguistic and geographic profile is as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Genetic Classification:</strong> It is a dialect of the Mahasu Pahari language.[1, 2]</li>
                            <li><strong>Geographic Location:</strong> It is spoken primarily in the Kullu and Shimla districts of Himachal Pradesh.[1, 3]</li>
                            <li><strong>Nomenclature:</strong> The term "Outer" distinguishes it from a related dialect, "Inner Siraji," which is also spoken in the Kullu district.[1, 4]</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This dialect must be carefully distinguished from <strong>Sarazi</strong>, a separate linguistic entity in Jammu & Kashmir:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Genetic Classification:</strong> Sarazi is recognized as a distinct Western Pahari language, not a dialect of another language.[5, 6] Historically, Sir George A. Grierson classified it as a dialect of Kashmiri due to certain shared verbal features, but modern linguistic analysis and speaker self-identification align it with the Western Pahari group.[5, 7]</li>
                            <li><strong>Geographic Location:</strong> It is spoken in the Saraz region, which encompasses the northern half of Doda district and parts of the neighboring Ramban and Kishtwar districts in Jammu & Kashmir.[5, 6]</li>
                            <li><strong>Nomenclature:</strong> It is also referred to as Siraji (of Doda) and has its own distinct dialects, such as Bhagwali and Deswali.[1, 6]</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The existence of these two unrelated "Siraji" varieties presents a significant operational risk. A project team conducting literature reviews or database searches must apply stringent filters to ensure that only data pertaining to the Mahasu Pahari dialect of Himachal Pradesh is included. The following table provides a clear comparative reference to guide this process.</p>

                        <h4>1.2 Geographic Distribution</h4>
                        <p>Modern sociolinguistic research provides a relatively precise location for the Outer Siraji speaker community. A comprehensive survey conducted for SIL International in 1986 identified the core speaking area as the <strong>Ani and Nirmand tehsils of the Kullu District</strong> in Himachal Pradesh.[3, 10] This southern part of the district is often referred to as the "Outer Seraj".[3]</p>
                        <p>The linguistic boundary is not sharp. The dialect's influence extends south into the adjacent Shimla District. A variety known as "Shimla Saraji," also identified as a dialect of Mahasu Pahari, is spoken in the areas of <strong>Theog and Kotkhai</strong>.[11, 12] The SIL survey report posits that the Outer Siraji spoken in Kullu may, in fact, be linguistically closer to the Pahari dialects of the bordering Shimla District than it is to the standard Kullui dialect spoken further north in the Kullu Valley.[3, 13]</p>
                        <p>This evidence points to the existence of a "dialect chain" or continuum, a common feature in mountainous regions where linguistic change occurs gradually from one valley to the next.[3] For the purposes of this project, the primary focus for fieldwork should be the tehsils of Ani and Nirmand, with secondary investigation in Theog and Kotkhai to document the full extent of the dialect.</p>

                        <h4>1.3 Linguistic Classification</h4>
                        <p>The genetic classification of Outer Siraji is well-established within the Indo-Aryan language family tree. Its lineage is as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Indo-European:</strong> The macro-family that includes most languages of Europe, the Iranian plateau, and northern South Asia.[2]</li>
                            <li><strong>Indo-Iranian:</strong> The branch of Indo-European that splits into the Iranian and Indo-Aryan sub-branches.[2]</li>
                            <li><strong>Indo-Aryan (Northern Zone):</strong> The sub-branch covering a vast number of languages in South Asia.[2]</li>
                            <li><strong>Western Pahari:</strong> A group of genetically related Indo-Aryan languages spoken across the lower Himalayas, from Himachal Pradesh to parts of Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand.[2, 14] The term "Pahari" itself simply means 'of the hills'.[15]</li>
                            <li><strong>Mahasu Pahari (Mahasui):</strong> A specific Western Pahari language spoken by approximately one million people (as of 2002) in the Shimla and Solan districts of Himachal Pradesh.[2]</li>
                            <li><strong>Outer Siraji:</strong> Classified as a dialect of Mahasu Pahari, specifically belonging to the "Upper Mahasu Pahari" group, which also includes Rampuri (Kochi), Rohruri, and Sodochi.[1, 2]</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This classification is crucial as it allows for the use of linguistic data from the parent language, Mahasu Pahari, as a reliable proxy for reconstructing the features of Outer Siraji where direct documentation is lacking.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Section 2: Historical Documentation and Contemporary Research</h3>
                        <p>A thorough understanding of a language's documented history is essential for modern preservation work. It provides a baseline for grammatical and lexical data, reveals how the language has been perceived by scholars over time, and helps identify critical gaps in knowledge. The documentation for Outer Siraji rests on a small but significant corpus of colonial-era linguistics, supplemented by a handful of modern academic studies.</p>
                        
                        <h4>2.1 The Colonial Foundation: Grierson and Bailey</h4>
                        <p>The earliest and most detailed linguistic descriptions of Outer Siraji originate from the monumental survey work conducted during the British Raj. While these sources are invaluable, they must be approached with an awareness of their methodological context. The data they contain represents a historical snapshot collected under specific constraints, and it serves as a foundational hypothesis to be tested and refined through contemporary fieldwork, rather than as an immutable record.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sir George A. Grierson's <em>Linguistic Survey of India</em> (LSI)</strong>, conducted between 1894 and 1928, is the most comprehensive linguistic survey of the subcontinent ever undertaken.[16] The volume of direct relevance to this project is <strong>Volume IX, Part IV: <em>Specimens of the Pahārī Languages and Gujurī</em></strong>, published in 1916.[16, 17] This volume contains grammatical sketches, comparative wordlists, and text specimens for numerous Western Pahari dialects, including those of the Kullu region. The full volume is accessible in digital format via the Internet Archive, and its lexical data can be queried through a searchable online database of the LSI, which will be an indispensable tool for initial vocabulary extraction.[16, 17] However, the LSI's methodology had known limitations. Grierson relied on a network of government officials and local schoolteachers to collect data, rather than trained linguists working directly with a cross-section of the community.[16] This approach risked introducing a formal or "schooled" bias into the data, potentially overlooking colloquial forms and reflecting a more Sanskritized version of the language than was in common use.</p>
                        <p><strong>T. Grahame Bailey's <em>Languages of the Northern Himalayas</em></strong> (1908) is arguably the single most important historical document for this project. Unlike the broad scope of the LSI, Bailey's work provides focused studies of twenty-six specific Himalayan dialects.[18, 19] Crucially, it contains a dedicated chapter titled <strong>"OUTER SIRĀJĪ,"</strong> spanning pages 37 to 43.[9] This chapter represents the most direct and detailed grammatical description of the dialect from the colonial period. Bailey's work was largely pioneering, as he noted that grammars for most of these dialects had not been previously published.[20] This resource, also available in full digital scans online, will be the primary source for reconstructing the historical grammar and morphology of Outer Siraji.[19, 21]</p>
                        
                        <h4>2.2 Modern Scholarly Contributions</h4>
                        <p>Research in the post-colonial era has been sparse but has yielded critical insights that update and, in some cases, correct the historical record.</p>
                        <p><strong>Frank Blair's SIL Sociolinguistic Survey:</strong> A survey conducted in 1985-86 and published as a report by SIL International in 2021, titled <em>A Sociolinguistic Profile of Kullu District, Himachal Pradesh</em>, is the most significant modern source on the dialect's context.[3, 10] This work provides a clear sociolinguistic snapshot, confirming the location of Outer Siraji in Ani and Nirmand tehsils and classifying it as one of three main dialects of Kullui Pahari (ISO 639-3: kfx), alongside Kullui proper and Inner Siraji.[3, 13] The report assesses language attitudes, finding them to be generally positive among speakers, and evaluates the extent of bilingualism in Hindi, which is not found to be universally fluent in rural areas.[3] This confirms that the dialect, while endangered, was still a vital language of home and community life as of the 1980s.</p>
                        <p><strong>J. C. Sharma's "Outer Siraji: An SVO language" (2003):</strong> This academic paper, published in the <em>International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics</em>, makes a profound linguistic contribution by identifying the dialect's basic word order as Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).[8] This is a typologically significant finding, as most languages of the region, including Hindi and Punjabi, are strictly SOV. This marks Outer Siraji as a linguistic outlier and a subject of great interest for historical syntax, suggesting it may have preserved an older Indo-Aryan syntactic structure or been influenced by a different linguistic substratum. While the full text of the paper is not readily available, its abstract and citations confirm this core finding, which must be a central focus of the documentation effort.[8, 22]</p>
                        
                        <h4>2.3 Assessment of Existing Lexicographical Resources</h4>
                        <p>The availability of dedicated dictionaries for Outer Siraji is extremely limited, necessitating a strategy of aggregation from direct and proxy sources.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Direct Dictionaries:</strong> A publication titled <em>A Dictionary Of Pahari Dialects</em> is available on the Internet Archive.[23] The contents of this dictionary and its specific coverage of Outer Siraji must be thoroughly examined as a first step. Beyond this, no other dedicated dictionaries for Outer Siraji have been identified.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proxy Dictionaries and Wordlists:</strong> Given that Outer Siraji is a dialect of Mahasu Pahari, resources for the parent language are of immense value. The most important of these is the <strong>Living Dictionaries online platform for Mahasuvi</strong>, which contains 1,149 entries.[24] This resource is particularly useful as it includes audio pronunciations, English and Hindi glosses, and often specifies the dialect in which a word is used, including "Shimla Saraji".[24] This existing digital lexicon can serve as the foundational dataset for the new online resource.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aggregated Vocabulary:</strong> Further vocabulary can be systematically extracted from other sources. The LSI and Bailey's work contain numerous example sentences and wordlists that can be digitized.[9, 16] The Cluster of Lexical-Semantic Relations (CLICS) database also contains a wordlist for Mahasu Pahari that can be mined for cognates.[25] Finally, informal sources, such as community discussions on platforms like Reddit, occasionally yield valuable lexical items and usage examples provided by native speakers, which can be used as leads for verification during fieldwork.[12, 26]</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Section 3: Linguistic Profile of Outer Siraji</h3>
                        <p>Constructing a linguistic profile of a sparsely documented dialect is an exercise in both synthesis and reconstruction. By combining the direct historical descriptions of Outer Siraji with the more comprehensive modern data available for its parent language, Mahasu Pahari, it is possible to create a robust working model of its phonology, grammar, and lexicon. This model will serve as the essential framework for guiding new fieldwork and structuring the digital database.</p>

                        <h4>3.1 Phonology: The Sound System</h4>
                        <p>No specific phonological analysis dedicated solely to Outer Siraji was identified. Therefore, the phonemic inventory of Mahasu Pahari, as documented in modern linguistic sources, provides the most reliable working model for the dialect's sound system.[2, 27]</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Consonants:</strong> The consonant system is characteristic of the Indo-Aryan languages of the region. It features a four-way phonation distinction in its plosives and affricates: voiceless (e.g., $p, t, k$), voiceless aspirated (e.g., $pʰ, tʰ, kʰ$), voiced (e.g., $b, d, g$), and breathy-voiced (e.g., $bʱ, dʱ$).[2] A significant feature is the presence of a full series of retroflex consonants ($ʈ, ʈʰ, ɖ, ɳ, ɽ, ɭ$), which are produced with the tip of the tongue curled back and are often challenging for speakers of European languages to distinguish and produce.[2, 27] The inventory also includes a set of affricates ($ts, tsʰ, dz, tʃ, dʒ$) and fricatives ($s, z, ʃ, ɦ$).[2]</li>
                            <li><strong>Vowels:</strong> The vowel system of Mahasu Pahari includes a standard set of oral vowels with phonemic length distinction (e.g., /i/ vs. /iː/, /u/ vs. /uː/) and a corresponding set of nasalized vowels (e.g., /ĩ/, /ũ/, /ẽ/, /õ/).[2]</li>
                            <li><strong>Suprasegmentals:</strong> Mahasu Pahari has been described as having "tonal qualities".[27] This is a critical area for investigation in Outer Siraji. In many languages of the Himalayan region, pitch can be phonemic, meaning a change in tone can change the meaning of a word, similar to the function of consonants and vowels. Field research must include careful listening for and recording of tonal contrasts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The table below presents the reconstructed phonemic inventory for Outer Siraji, based on the documented system of Mahasu Pahari.[2] The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is used for precision.</p>
